# ExcersiseAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

ExcersiseAI is your virtual coaching assistant that analyzez training sessions and designs personalised training programs to fulfill goals in the gym. By analyzing training sessions and statistics from different monitors it can look at aspects that needs improving. 

## Background

It can help towards achieving a personal goal or even help in competitive training for different sports. For example a personalised training plan for a football player or a gymnast. Furthermore, it can be even more personalised after data and  few sessions. For example if you are a defender in football or a winger, you may need to focus on different aspects in the gym. Similarly if you are a gymnast and specialize in one area the training sessions should differ. 


## How is it used?
 Everyone from professional athletes to regular people who enjoy excersising. In order for it to work it requires activity from the user e.g. giving feedback and uploading statistics from different drills.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data is a combination of user-input data and wearable data. The user needs to select a goal and the AI creates a personalised program to fulfill it and then the user needs to log workouts and give feedback on difficulty and results. The wearable data aspect involves using a smartwatch for example to gather data for the AI to give a deeper analysis and progression over the program. 

## Challenges

In case of an injury, there is no safety

## What next?

Applying professionals viewpoints and maybe helping with recovery from injuries. The medical aspects.
